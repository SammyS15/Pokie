Review of May 2nd AND 7th Meeting

For the convergence proof, Justine identified that to get the 2/3 upper limit 
indicating that the model is well calibrated and 1/2 lower limit indicating that the model 
is not calibrated and is dependent on the assumption of P(\lambda). 

Currently, we have that P(\lambda) is from a uniform distribution however if it is NOT a uniform 
distribution the upper and lower limit values are different. Thus to move forward with the 
convergence proof we need to prove that P(\lambda) is from a uniform distribution.

Mathematically proving this is difficult and neither of us has been able to show that 
P(\lambda) is from a uniform distribution. However, Sammy is an informal proof that provides a 
Semi-Empircal Setup shows that P(\lambda) is from a uniform distribution based on how we define 
the center of the hypersphere as well as the radius of the hypersphere.
- The TLDR is that the center is sampled from a Uniform distribution and the radius is defined 
    from the  center & a random posterior sample, and repeating this process many times, we can 
    claim that the  probability mass of the samples falling inside the hypersphere is from a uniform 
    distribution.

Justine has an idea based on the setup for the convergence proof. We can calculate the empirical 
convergence values based on the current posterior samples and then take the Pokie values, take the 
difference, and repeat for multiple  models. Thus a value closer to 0 indicates a well-calibrated 
model and a value further away from 0 indicates a poorly calibrated model.
- Justine is going to write out the empirical convergence value calculation and Sammy is going to 
    implement this in the code.

We then need to decide if both OR one of these ideas is the correct way forward. This is not only 
important for the convergence proof but also for claiming we can do model comparison as we need a way 
of claiming that a model with a lower pokie value is a worse model.

To-Do List:
Sammy
- Clean up the Pokie Source Code -- Modifications have been made since the last time it was pushed
- Clean up the New Experiments
- Generate Lens from Andi's NPE/NRE Paper Setup and Run Pokie
- Implement Empirical Convergence Value Calculation & Analysis

Justine
- Write out Empirical Convergence Value Calculation

Both 
- Clean up the paper and make it cleaner
